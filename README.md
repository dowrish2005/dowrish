# 🔐 Guarding Transactions: AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention

## 🚀 Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms — **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — to predict the likelihood of credit card scams based on historical transaction data. It is designed to assist in securing financial systems by flagging fraudulent transactions with high precision.

Built as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan Skill Development Program**, this solution demonstrates how AI can be used for real-time fraud prevention in digital payments.

## 📊 Dataset Reference
We use the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## 🎯 Objective
To predict the **likelihood of a credit card scam** using supervised machine learning techniques and help reduce financial fraud.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier
